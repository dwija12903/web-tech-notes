Node is a js runtime, it is not a language or a library
its runs as service using v8 javascript engine, v8 is written
c++ and is extremly fast. Node is used more fore Rest API and 
microservices,whichserves json as datatype most of the time.

Why node? instaed of other serviceside technologies like php or python
Fast,efficent and highly scalable bcoz it is event-driven and runs in 
single loop and its non blocking i/o model. Used in both frontend and backend

Non-blocking 
works on a single thread, php is syncronous it works on multiple thread, each time
request is made it spwans new thread. Syncronous needs to wait for one process to get 
completed before staring next. Node is Asyncronous and non blocking single
thread supports 1000's and 10-1000;s on many connections which are held in event loop
which optimizes throughput and scalability in application with many i/o operations.
Dont use node with cpu intensive apps. 

Event loop
learn diagram 
it runs on single loop and runs asyncronously
when a event is triggered a callback fires, so system doesnot have to run a process
sit and wait for it and then run next. It simply runs and process and moves on. Once event is 
fullfies it runs in a loop.

node is not good for cpu intensive apps or projects

npm-node package manager, used to download libraies and packages 

node modules 
modules are huge part of node and it has a large set of core modules
we can create our own module of a file that has an exports.
we can include variables, function all the things from one file to another
